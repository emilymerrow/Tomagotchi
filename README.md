# TOMAGOTCHI

## Description

Welcome to Tomagotchi! A place where you can own a pet even if you're allergic to them, and most of all take it on vacation with you!
Tamagotchi was invented by Aki Maita and Akihiro Yokoi in 1996 in Tokyo. 
They both won the 1997 Ig Nobel Prize!
Tamagotchi is a keychain-sized virtual pet simulation game. 
The idea of Tomagotchi spiked from an advertisement where a boy wasn't allowed to bring his pet turtle on vacation.

Your pet will start at Age 0, and grow one age value every 15 seconds.
Every time it hits a new Age level, the pet will grow in pixels and also at Age 3 it will change its hairstyle to a funky one as it reaches the adolescent value of Age 3.

Your pet will need to be fed, put to bed, and played with to keep it alive. 
Those values start at 1 and it represents your pet at it's optimal levels of happiness and contentment but the health of your pet declines as those values reach higher number and eventually die if any f the feed, sleep, or play reaches 10. To keep your pet healthy you will need to click the three buttons on the bottom and for every click it will decrease by 1 to avoid getting to level 10 where your pet will die.

When the pet is dead, the pixeled immage will turn red.
